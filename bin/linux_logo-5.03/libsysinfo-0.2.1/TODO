+ Update AIX and Irix ports to the new architecture
+ Merge in FreeBSD patches
+ A cygwin port exists for windows.  Does anyone have the source?
+ Separate libsysinfo off as a separate library?
+ Make libsysinfo a shared-library?
+ Create a ./configure script?  This is painful and large, but
  maybe I should eventually do this.
+ Possibly use the intel CPUID instruction ourselves?  This would
  duplicate a lot of linux-kernel code, but would let us have a
  lot of control, plus the same code could in theory work on
  all x86 platforms [Linux,*BSD,w32]
