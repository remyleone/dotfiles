Linux sysinfo gathering:

cpuinfo is obtained from parsing /proc/cpuinfo.
        This can be convoluted at times, especially since every stable
	kernel release seems to change the format.
	
	Thankfully with the advent of the 'cpuinfo' instruction things
	have stabalized a bit.
	
	Some complex parsing goes on to give cleaner output.
	
os_info is obtained using the uname() function.

hostname is also obtained using the uname() function

memory is obtained by a fstat() on /proc/kcore
        
	this sometimes ends up a Megabyte short if ACPI or APM
	are in use.
	
	Other methods are available. 
	
	+ /proc/meminfo tends to always turn up a few megabytes short
	  because it ignores reserved and kernel memory
	  
	+ the sysinfo() function has similar problems
	
uptime is obtained from /proc/uptime

loadaverage is obtained from /proc/loadavg

	+ this is proc filesystem dependent of course.
	  Maybe I should look into sysinfo()
