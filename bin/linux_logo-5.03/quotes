    It passed the lonely Mountain bare
and swept above the dragon's lair :
there black and dark lay boulders stark
and flying smoke was in the air.



Stick to the forest-track, keep
your spirits up, hope for the best, and with a tremendous slice of luck you
may come out one day and see the Long Marshes lying below you, and beyond
them, high in the East, the Lonely Mountain where dear old Smaug lives, though
I hope he is not expecting you."



The Lonely Mountain! Bilbo had
come far and through many adventures to see it, and now he did not like the
look of it in the least.



     You have nice manners for a thief and a liar," said the dragon. "You seem
familiar with my name, but I don't seem to remember smelling you before. Who
are you and where do you come from, may I ask?"
     "You may indeed! I come from under the hill, and under hills and over the
hills my paths led. And through the air, I am he that walks unseen."


     "I am the clue-finder, the web-cutter, the stinging fly. I as chosen for
the lucky number."
     "Lovely titles!" sneered the dragon. "But lucky numbers don't always come
off."


     "I am he that buries his friends alive and drowns them and draws them
alive again from the water. I came from the end of a bag, but no bag went over
me."
     "These don't sound so creditable," scoffed Smaug.


Somehow the killing of a giant spider, all alone by himself in the dark without the help of a wizard or the dwarves or anyone else, made a great difference to Mr. Baggins. He felt a different person, and much fiercer and bolder in spite of an empty stomach as he wiped his sword on the grass and put it back into its sheath.

My armor is like tenfold shields, my teeth are swords, my claws spears, the shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane and my breath death.

So snow comes after fire and even dragons have their ending! I wish now only to be in my own arm-chair!
